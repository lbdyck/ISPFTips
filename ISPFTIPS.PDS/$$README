This PDS contains the sample code that is referenced in the ISPF Tips
and Tricks publication. Code snippets are not included here as the
snippets are short examples.

An ISPF dialog has been provided to simplify access to these examples.

To experiment with the samples:  Execute the $DEVISPF exec

There are 2 TSO Transmit (XMIT) format files must be received and
installed to be used. These are members #RXFORM and #TRYIT. Issue a
TSO RECEIVE on these members to recreate them and then copy them
back into this PDS.

To experiment with these copy the REXX members into a library included in
your SYSEXEC (or SYSPROC) concatenation, and copy the Panel members into
a library in your ISPPLIB concatenation.

Documentation can be found at www.lbdsoftware.com where it is available in
ePUB, Mobi (Old Kindle), AZW3 (New Kindle) and PDF formats.
